# Elementor Form - Restrict Submission by other Forms submissions. 
Adds a custom control to Elementor Forms for restricting submissions by current submissions in other Forms. Pretty self explanatory.

Pretty usefull if you want to limit submission to only one form when having 2 or more forms.
Example: you have 2 form to subscribe to 2 different courses/webinars and they're held on the same day and at the same time.
